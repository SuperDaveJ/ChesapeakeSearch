		  <popText>
			  <paragraph>Knowledge Checks are questions that are designed to let you test your understanding and retention of what you've learned. You will be able to read feedback about your answers that will help you understand why particular choices are correct or incorrect.</paragraph>
			  <paragraph>Most knowledge review questions allow two attempts. If you answer incorrectly on your first attempt, you will be prompted to try again. If you answer incorrectly on your second try, the correct response will be provided.</paragraph>

		  <popTitle>Multiple Choice</popTitle>
		  <popText>
			  <paragraph>It's a safe bet that you're already familiar with multiple choice style questions. In this course, a multiple choice question with one correct answer uses radio buttons. When you try to select another answer, the first one you chose becomes deselected.</paragraph>
			  <paragraph>A multiple choice question that has more than one correct answer will use checkboxes. This type of question will allow you to select as many answers as you want. As with most questions in the course, you will need to click Submit in order to see feedback for your response.</paragraph>

		  <popTitle>Matching (Drag and Drop)</popTitle>
		  <popText>
			  <paragraph>In this course, drag and drop interactions are used to build a list of items in a category. To complete a drag and drop interaction, you will drag items from the list to the correct answers list. If the item correctly answers the question, the interaction will provide you with the correct feedback. If the item does not answer the question correctly, it will simply return to its place in the list.</paragraph>

			  <paragraph>Below is an example of an Elimination Challenge style interaction, which is a type of elimination interaction you will see in this course. Similar to the drag and drop interaction described previously, to complete an elimination challenge interaction, you will drag items from the list to the trash can. If the item correctly answers the question, the interaction will provide you with the correct feedback. If the item does not answer the question correctly, it will simply return to its place in the list.</paragraph>
