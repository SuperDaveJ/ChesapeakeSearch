			  <paragraph>Selecting the highlighted text will launch a popup box like this one with more information about the topic. Even though you may know the meaning of a word in bold text, it is important to click on it because much more information may be included in the popup box than a simple definition. For example, the popup may contain a table or graphic that can help clarify a concept.</paragraph>
