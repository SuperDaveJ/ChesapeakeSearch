READ THIS BEFORE UPDATING THE DEMONSTRATIONS

Each Show Me/Try Me needs the "filename"_steps.xml and the assets folder to work. And they need to be in the same directory as the "filename".swf file. You will find the assets folder, "filename"_steps.xml and "filename".swf file in the "module#" folders, where '#" represents module 1...module 6.

The asset folder contains the sub-folders “audio” and “screens.”  The "filename"_steps.xml file for each flash file includes the text for each step that appears when you play the demonstration. The flash file reads the text inside the "filename"_steps.xml file so it’s important that the "filename"_steps.xml file name stays the same.

The audio ("filename".mp3) and graphic ("filename".jpgs) files that correlate with each flash file have the same name. For example, the flash file 02_00_012.swf would include 02_00_012_1.mp3 & 02_00_012_1.jpg for Step 1 and so on for each step. 

If you need to change the text for the step, do the following:
1.	Open the "filename"_steps.xml file.
2.	Find the step and change it.
3.	Save the file.

If you need to change the audio/graphic file, do the following:
1.	Copy over the new file and it will replace it. 
2.	Make sure it has the same name.
